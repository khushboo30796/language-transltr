1. One of the points discussed in class was about the kind of licensing agreement in place 
for cases where freely available software is made part of a larger commercially 
beneficial package. Think about this and come up with a possible license of your own 
that would facilitate this. 
2. Why `Open Source Hardware' not as commonly is talked of? Think how a concept like 
this could evolve. 
3. Think of scenarios where 'pair programming' would probably be more effective than 
individual programming and why? 
4. Crowd sourcing software development is often looked upon as just another variant of 
open source software development. Do you agree or disagree with this.
